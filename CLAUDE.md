# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new repository for an "rgrep-mcp" project. The repository currently contains only Claude Code configuration files.

## Development Setup

The repository is currently empty and awaiting initial project setup. Future development will likely involve:

- Setting up the project structure and dependencies
- Implementing core functionality for the rgrep-mcp tool
- Adding appropriate build, test, and lint configurations

## Configuration

- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` to allow `find` and `ls` bash commands
